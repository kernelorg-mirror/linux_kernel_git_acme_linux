# perf-stuck - tell a spinning perf apart from a blocked or recursing one
#
# Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>
#
# PROTOTYPE: this wants to become a first class 'perf stuck' command, that
# samples a running perf, or any other process, from inside perf, with the
# knowledge of the phases perf goes through and of the DWARF type chasing
# loops built in, instead of this shell script poking at /proc and shelling
# out to gdb.  It is here as a stopgap, to be able to tell where a perf is
# stuck while looking at hangs such as the one 'perf report -s type' hits
# on dwz compressed debug info.
#
# Samples /proc/<pid> at a fixed interval and prints, for each sample:
#
#   the CPU time used since the previous sample, so a process burning a
#   full interval's worth of ticks is spinning, while one using none is
#   blocked
#
#   the [stack] mapping start, which moves down as the stack grows, the
#   giveaway for runaway recursion, together with its size
#
#   the last line of a progress log, when one is given, e.g. the stderr
#   of 'perf report --progress', to see which phase is stuck
#
# A process that burns CPU with a constant stack and no progress is in an
# unbounded loop, e.g. a die_get_pointer_type() chain that got into a
# cycle, while one whose [stack] start keeps moving down is recursing.
#
# With -g it runs gdb, using the perf-stuck.gdb that sits next to this
# script, when no progress is made for two consecutive samples, which for
# a perf in a DWARF type chasing loop prints the DIE chain it is walking.
#
# usage: perf-stuck.sh [options] <pid|process-name>
